<h1>Romania</h1>

    <h2>CCDR Summary</h2>
    <p>Romania has made impressive strides in raising its economic performance over the past two decades but continues to face substantive economic, inclusion, and sustainability challenges. The country has achieved significant economic progress, transitioning to a market-based economy, acceding to the European Union (EU) in 2007, and reaching high-income status. From 2000 to 2022, living standards more than doubled, with real GDP per capita increasing from US$12,177 to US$32,738. Despite these advancements, regional disparities in income and service delivery remain wide, with poverty and inequality rates among the highest in the EU, particularly concentrated in rural areas (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 7)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Romania is actively pursuing Net Zero by 2050 (Net0@2050). As a Member State of the EU, Romania has committed to key tenets of the European Green Deal (EGD), aiming to reduce net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 relative to 1990 levels and achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Despite significant reductions in emissions over recent decades, achieving these goals will require substantial policy action and investments, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors. The CCDR highlights the importance of public and political buy-in to meet these ambitious objectives (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 8)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Early success in reducing emissions will need to be followed by determined efforts to decarbonize the entire economy. While good progress has been made in reducing Romania’s emissions, much of this was due to structural changes in the economy during the post-Communist era. The CCDR stresses the need for increased energy efficiency and a shift away from fossil fuels across all sectors to achieve the Net0@2050 target (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 9)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>The CCDR outlines the critical role of electrification and energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transport. A major electrification program will be necessary to remove direct consumption of fossil fuels and replace it with energy from non-fossil fuel sources. This transition will require substantial investments in renewable energy, energy storage, and infrastructure. Additionally, increasing energy efficiency in buildings and industry is crucial for reducing emissions and achieving the near-zero energy building stock by 2050 as outlined in the EU’s Renovation Wave strategy (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 10)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Decarbonizing the transport sector remains a significant challenge due to underdeveloped infrastructure and the high carbon intensity of the existing vehicle fleet. The CCDR recommends accelerating investments in public transport, rail infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging networks to reduce emissions from road transport, which accounts for a significant portion of Romania’s transport emissions (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 11)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Romania’s agricultural and forestry sectors face the dual challenge of needing to increase productivity while reducing emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration. The CCDR emphasizes the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, expansion of irrigation systems, and large-scale land rationalization and afforestation to mitigate climate impacts and support economic growth in rural areas (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 12)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Addressing water scarcity and improving integrated water resource management are crucial for Romania’s adaptation to climate change. The CCDR points out the urgent need for investments in water storage and irrigation infrastructure to cope with increasing droughts and variability in precipitation. Enhanced management and conservation of water resources are vital for supporting agriculture, energy production, and urban resilience (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 13)">CCDR</a>).</p>

    <p>Finally, the CCDR highlights the necessity of a well-coordinated and inclusive transition to a green economy. Ensuring that the benefits of decarbonization are equitably distributed and that vulnerable populations are supported through targeted social policies and skills development programs is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth (<a href="#" onclick="goToPage('Romania', 'CCDR', 14)">CCDR</a>).</p>
