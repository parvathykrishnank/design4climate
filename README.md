## About the CLAD-ECA

The Climate Legislation and Action Database in ECA (CLAD-ECA) is a repository of climate-relevant national-level legislation, strategies, action plans, and policies in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region.

The CLAD-ECA is developed and maintained by the Design for Climate (D4C) team of the World Bank Global Practice (GP) Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy (ENB) in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region for the purpose of ensuring climate corporate commitments for World Bank operations in ECA Region.

In addition, the CLAD-ECA online resource has been prepared with the support of the Mainstreaming a Whole-of-Economy Approach to Climate Change in ECA - Strengthening Government Capacity to Lead the Green Transition Program (P180441-TF0C0427). The activity was supported by the Climate Support Facility Whole-of-Economy Program, administered by the World Bank.

The CLAD-ECA covers the following:

- **Country Management Unit (CMU):** Western Balkans, Central Asia, South Caucasus, Turkiye, Eastern Europe, and European Union.
- **Countries:** Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Austria, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, TÃ¼rkiye, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
